    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>My photography can be found at Cheddarness.com. I used to ask my siblings and parents for their old film cameras, since it would give me an excuse to go out and explore the world. While I do not do too much film photography now (because the film and processing of the film has gotten very expesnive), I spent a considerable amount of time exploring the world through my photography. I eventually displayed my photos in a few exhibitions across Los Angeles.</p>

    <h1>Visuals</h1>
    <p>As a producer and DJ of Techno music, I have developed an interest for creating visuals that support the music I play and make, since visuals are a massive compliment to the hypnotic effects of Techno. Here are some works I have created to compliment the music I play/make. First, the “face” video was created with the AI website “thispersondoesnotexist”. I wanted to simulate the experience of being in a rave amongst a sea of people you don’t know, and will most likely never see again. It is a unique experience to share the emotions of the night with strangers, dancing the night away. Those visuals were made for a rave I DJed at in AprilSecond, I produced a song that is more intense/harder than the techno I usually produce, yet was very happy with the result. I wanted to create a visual experience that shared the intensity of the kick, the screech, and the top-end. I compiled videos I liked from animes (some I have watched some I haven’t), and created a TouchDesigner system that is reactive to the kick. When the kick hits, a ton of distortion and glitch-effect floods the screen. I intended on doing this to replicate the feeling of melting when a Kick that had hits the speakers. Lastly, I created a visual that displayed a 3D scan of my face. Similar to the second visual, the visual was responsive to the kick. I connected my Drum machine and Acid bass to Ableton, and Ableton to Touchdesigner. I chose to display my head to show the “personal” it feels to live DJ.</p>

    <h1>Videos</h1>
    <p>I used to spend a lot of time shooting random videos around 2 years ago. I used to shoot music videos for local rappers, which I had fun with for a short time. I primarily used old VHS cameras I would find garage sales to show how much you can do with inexpensive equipment, primarily using video effects I would find inside the camera. During my first Deltopia at UCSB, I decided to document what I saw throughout the day with one of the cameras, and created a short video for Youtube using a rapid editing style to emphasize the large and fast paced crowd during the massive party. In regards to my music, I recorded a DJ set last summer. I recorded a Trance set and wanted to edit a video alongside my music to make the viewing/listening experience more fun. The full hour set can be found on YouTube, but the clip below was a teaser a posted to my instagram to introduce people to the lightheartedness and positive mood I tried to depict in the video</p>
