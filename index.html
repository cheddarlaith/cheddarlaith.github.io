    <section class="intro">
      <p>I believe that creativity is something that should be exercised, just like a muscle. I began realizing this in high school, when I met a group of music producers that made trap beats, and prioritized building a routine for their craft.</p>
      <p>I picked up film photography and videographer when I first moved to the US. I did not have too many friends and found company and peace through capturing moments through my films. I began commissioning myself for editing and filming music videos for around a year, until I became tired of working for other people.</p>
      <p>I started making rap beats during middle school, since I felt like I was one of the only people in my grade that liked that kind of music. After losing interest throughout high school, I fell in love with Techno during the summer of 2022, and wanted to create a hypnotic experience through production and DJing. I have released songs on SoundCloud, played and hosted raves in Isla Vista, and have collaborated with artists across the world through Techno. I am actively working on building my experience with the genre and I am actively proposing an honors thesis for the Psychology lab I am volunteering in for research around Techno music and decision making. </p>
      <p>I hope to push people to their limit when it comes to music, blending distorted sounds to bring out uncomfortable emotions and experiences and rewarding listeners by breaking out of their comfort zone during dance.</p>

    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>My photography can be found at Cheddareness.com. I used to ask my siblings and parents for their old film cameras, since it would give me an excuse to go out and explore the world. While I do not do too much film photography now (because the film and processing of the film has gotten very expensive), I spent a considerable amount of time exploring the world through my photography. I eventually displayed my photos in a few exhibitions across Los Angeles.</p>

    <h1>Visuals</h1>
    <p>As a producer and DJ of Techno music, I create visuals to support the music. The “face” video uses the AI site “thispersondoesnotexist” to evoke being among strangers at a rave. I also built a TouchDesigner system reactive to the kick: when the kick hits, distortion/glitch floods the screen to mirror the intensity of the track. Lastly, I built a visual around a 3D scan of my face, driven live by my drum machine and acid bass via Ableton → TouchDesigner.</p>

    <h1>Videos</h1>
    <p>I’ve shot music videos and VHS-style experiments using thrifted cameras. During my first Deltopia at UCSB, I documented the day with a rapid edit to match the pace of the crowd. For my music, I recorded a Trance DJ set and edited a playful visual to make the viewing/listening experience more fun. The full set is on YouTube; the clip here is a teaser.</p>
